                    Now that you learned everything about NFT, let’s talk about why you should make a donation in
                    exchange for NFTs from your favorite charity? Because you will receive a rare one of a kind
                    collectible that you can sell in the future as its value grows. Your charity will continue to
                    receive a portion of the sale as a donation for any subsequent sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, the big question is will my donation be tax deductible? Sure! Anything you pay above the
                    asking bid of your charity would be tax deductible. For example, if the asking bid of an NFT is
                    $100 and you pay $1,000 then $900 will be tax deductible and your charity will write you a
                    donation slip that you can submit to the IRS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you may ask, if I sell my NFT to another person, will it be tax deductible? The answer is -
                    it depends. If your charity adds a royalty option to the NFT then you can deduct that portion.
                    For example, if you decide to sell your $1,000 NFT for $5,000 and your charity has a 10% royalty
                    option then they will receive $500 (10% of $5,000) as donation from you and you can deduct that
                    amount as a charitable contribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a charity and I would like to know how NFTs can help me to raise more money? If you are a
                    charity fundraiser you know the most important thing is an honest and heartfelt communication
                    with your potential donors. Maya Angelou once said, “I've learned that people will forget what
                    you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

                    The days of spending thousands on silly gifts like key chains, and address labels are over. An
                    unique piece of digital art created by one of your volunteers, can be an amazing gift to your
                    donor. And most importantly, this is the gift that will keep giving.
